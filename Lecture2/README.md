# Lecture 2 Image Processing

## 1. What is Image Enhancement?

Image Enhancement is the process of making images more useful visually.

### Why do we need Image Enhancement?

1. Highlighting interesting details in images.
2. Removing noise.

An Example of Image Enhancement Functions:

### Types of Image Enhancement

1. Restoration : Removing noise from images.
2. Motion Deblurring : Removing blur from images.

## Image Enhancement Techniques

### Histogram

Histogram is a graphical representation of the intensity distribution of an image.

h(x) = number of pixels with intensity x

## Spatial Domain 

Spatial domain refers to the image plane itself rather than the transform domain. In spatial domain, the image is represented as a 2D array of intensity values.

### Point Processing

Point processing is a type of image enhancement technique that operates on individual pixels of an image.d``
